GNU Unifont is licensed under the SIL OFL v1.1, and our modifications as "sekaigu yunifon JP" are licensed under the same terms.
The licence text can be found under: licences/ofl-1.1.txt

FIXME: This needs a proper copyright attribution. It's currently being maintained by Unifoundry, but there seems to be no obvious way to use either the SIL OFL v1.1 or the GNU GPLv2+ that the font is licensed under. If someone knows what the attribution should be, please let me know so this can be sorted out correctly. Thanks! --GM
